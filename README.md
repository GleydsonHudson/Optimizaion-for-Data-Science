1) FW for problems with unbounded feasible set

A) "Frank-Wolfe Methods with an Unbounded Feasible Region and
Applications to Structured Learning"

  and analyze the theoretical properties of the algorithms described

Compare the algorithms in the paper with the accelerated 
projection-free method described in

B) "Projection-free accelerated method for convex
optimization"

Compare the algorithms described i A) and B) on one of the problems 
reported in section 5 of A)
