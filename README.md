# Optimizaion for Data Science Unipd 20/21

Read the paper:
    A) "Frank-Wolfe Methods with an Unbounded Feasible Region and Applications to Structured Learning"

Analyze the theoretical properties of the algorithms described in it.

Compare the algorithms in the paper with the accelerated projection-free method described in

  B) "Projection-free accelerated method for convex optimization"

Compare the algorithms described in A) and B) with one of the problems reported in section 5 of A)
